# Project Magilica

A game which was initially going to release for the Magical Girl Game Jam 7, but now improved within the Improve My Game Jam 26. Well, it is still a "debug" build because we couldn't implement the story on time, but we managed to make it "playable".

## How to install

Just download and unzip the file for your OS and run it.

## How to compile

Get Godot 3.5 Standard and its export package. Then compile it for whatever you like.
